### Boilerplate WebdriverIO project 


### Installation
## System requirements
Youâ€™ll need Node.js installed.

If you don't have Node installed, we recommend installing NVM to assist managing multiple active Node.js versions. If you are using the WDIO Testrunner in sync mode you also need Python v3 or higher installed.
